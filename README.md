# About this fork:

This fork is based on a fork by
[TheIronWolfModding](https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/dxvk) and adjusted
to work with [openRBRVR](https://github.com/Detegr/openRBRVR). This fork uses
only the d3d9 VR parts from the original fork, removing all GTR specific
changes. Some changes are added for providing OpenXR support for openRBRVR.

For more information about DXVK, see the [upstream
repo](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk).
